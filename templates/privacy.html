    <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
Last Updated: 1st-January-2024. <br>
This Privacy Policy ("Policy") explains the information collection, use, and sharing practices of
Friday technologies and Systems pvt ltd ("we," "us," and "our"). <br>
Unless otherwise stated, this Policy describes and governs the information collection, use, and
sharing practices of Friday technologies and Systems pvt ltd with respect to your use of our
website (https://www.fridayexp.com) and the services ("Services") we provide and/or host on our
servers.<br>
Before you use or submit any information through or in connection with the Services, please
carefully review this Privacy Policy. By using any part of the Services, you understand that your
information will be collected, used, and disclosed as outlined in this Privacy Policy.<br>
If you do not agree to this privacy policy, please do not use our Services.<br>
<h2>Our Principles</h2>
Friday technologies and Systems pvt ltd has designed this policy to be consistent with the
following principles:<br>
<ol>
    <li>Privacy policies should be human readable and easy to find.</li>
    <li>Data collection, storage, and processing should be simplified as much as possible to enhance
security, ensure consistency, and make the practices easy for users to understand.</li>
    <li>Data practices should meet the reasonable expectations of users.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
We collect information in multiple ways, including when you provide information directly to us;
when we passively collect information from you, such as from your browser or device; and from
third parties.
<h2>Information You Provide Directly to Us</h2>
We will collect any information you provide to us. We may collect information from you in a
variety of ways, such as when you: (a) create an online account, (b) make a donation or purchase,
(c) contact us or provide feedback, (d) subscribe to our newsletter (e)book an appointment (f) Fill
any of the forms available on our website. This information may include but is not limited to your
name, email address, phone number, mailing address, payment information and your geographic
location.
<h2>Information that Is Automatically Collected</h2>
<i>Device/Usage Information</i> <br>
We may automatically collect certain information about the computer or devices (including mobile
devices or tablets) you use to access the Services. As described further below, we may collect and
analyze (a) device information such as IP addresses, location information (by country and city),
unique device identifiers, IMEI and TCP/IP address, browser types, browser language, operating
system, mobile device carrier information, and (b) information related to the ways in which you
interact with the Services, such as referring and exit web pages and URLs, platform type, the
number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages and content viewed and the order of those
pages, statistical information about the use of the Services, the amount of time spent on particular
pages, the date and time you used the Services, the frequency of your use of the Services, error
logs, and other similar information. As described further below, we may use third-party analytics
providers and technologies, including cookies and similar tools, to assist in collecting this
information. <br>
<i>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</i> <br>
We also collect data about your use of the Services through the use of Internet server logs and
online tracking technologies, like cookies and/or tracking pixels. A web server log is a file where
website activity is stored. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer when you
visit a website, that enables us to: (a) recognize your computer; (b) store your preferences and
settings; (c) understand the web pages of the Services you have visited and the referral sites that
have led you to our Services; (d) enhance your user experience by delivering content specific to
your inferred interests; (e) perform searches and analytics; and (f) assist with security
administrative functions. Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are
tiny electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads and/or email, and
that are designed to provide usage information like ad impressions or clicks, measure popularity of
the Services and associated advertising, and to access user cookies. We may also use tracking
technologies in our license buttons and/or icons that you can embed on other sites/services to track
the website addresses where they are embedded, gauge user interaction with them, and determine
the number of unique viewers of them. If you receive email from us (such as the CC newsletter,
campaign updates, or other ongoing email communications from CC), we may use certain
analytics tools, such as clear GIFs, to capture data such as whether you open our message, click on
any links or banners our email contains, or otherwise interact with what we send. This data allows
us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns. As we adopt
additional technologies, we may also gather additional information through other methods.
Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated,
or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more
information. Please note that by blocking any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain
features or offerings of the Services. <br>
For more information about how we use cookies, please read our Cookie Policy. <br>
<h2>Information from Third Parties</h2>
To the extent permitted by law, we may also collect information from third parties, including
public sources, social media platforms, and marketing and market research firms. Depending on
the source, this information collected from third parties could include name, contact information,
demographic information, information about an individual's employer, information to verify
identity or trustworthiness, and information for other fraud or safety protection purposes.
<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
<ol>We may use the information we collect from and about you to:
    <li>Fulfil the purposes for which you provided it.</li>
    <li>Provide and improve the Services, including to develop new features or services, take steps
to secure the Services, and for technical and customer support.</li>

    </ol>

automatically collected information) with information we obtain about you from our affiliates
and/or non-affiliated third parties, and use such combined information in accordance with this
Privacy Policy. <br>

<h2>When We Disclose Your Information</h2>
We may disclose and/or share your information under the following circumstances:
<h2>Service Providers.</h2>
We may disclose your information with third parties who perform services on our behalf, including
without limitation, event management, marketing, customer support, data storage, data analysis
and processing, and legal services.
<h2>Legal Compliance and Protection of Creative Commons and Others.</h2>
We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or on a good faith belief that such
disclosure is permitted by this Privacy Policy or reasonably necessary or appropriate for any of the
following reasons: (a) to comply with legal process; (b) to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and
this Privacy Policy, or other contracts with you, including investigation of potential violations
thereof; (c) enforce our Charter including the Code of Conduct and policies contained and

and organizations for fraud protection, and spam/malware prevention, and similar purposes.
<h2>Business Transfers.</h2>
As we continue to develop our business, we may engage in certain business transactions, such as
the transfer or sale of our assets. In such transactions, (including in contemplation of such
transactions, e.g., due diligence) your information may be disclosed. If any of our assets are sold or
transferred to a third party, customer information (including your email address) would likely be
one of the transferred business assets.
<h2>Affiliated Companies.</h2>
We may disclose your information with current or future affiliated companies.
<h2>Consent.</h2>
We may disclose your information to any third parties based on your consent to do so.
<h2>Aggregate/De-identified Information.</h2>
We may disclose de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose to third parties, including
advertisers, promotional partners, and/or others.
<h2>Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data</h2>
The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal ground they rely on to
use or disclose information that can be directly linked to or used to identify you. To the extent
those laws apply, our legal grounds for processing such information are as follows:
<h2>To Honor Our Contractual Commitments to You.</h2>
Much of our processing of information is to meet our contractual obligations to provide services to
our users.
<h2>Legitimate Interests.</h2>
In many cases, we handle information on the ground that it furthers our legitimate interests in ways
that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected
individuals, these include:
<ol>
    <li>Customer service.</li>
    <li>Marketing, advertising, and fundraising.</li>
    <li>Protecting our users, personnel, and property.</li>
    <li>Managing user accounts.</li>
    <li>Organizing and running events and programs.</li>
    <li>Analyzing and improving our business.</li>
    <li>Managing legal issues.</li>
    <li>We may also process information for the same legitimate interests of our users and business
partners.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Legal Compliance.</h2>
We may need to use and disclose information in certain ways to comply with our legal obligations.
<h2>Consent.</h2>
Where required by law, and in some other cases where legally permissible, we handle information
on the basis of consent. Where we handle your information on the basis of consent, you have the
right to withdraw your consent; in accordance with applicable law.
<h2>Online Analytics</h2>
We may use third-party web analytics services (such as Google Analytics) on our Services to
collect and analyze the information discussed above, and to engage in auditing, research, or
reporting. The information (including your IP address) collected by various analytics technologies
described in the "Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies" section above will be disclosed to or
collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the
Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive to our Site, analyzing
usage trends, assisting with fraud prevention, and providing certain features to you. To prevent
Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the official Google
Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
<h2>Your Choices and Data Subject Rights</h2>
You have various rights with respect to the collection and use of your information through the
Services. Those choices are as follows:
<h2>Email Unsubscribe</h2>
You may unsubscribe from our marketing emails at any time by emailing info@fridayexp.com
with your request.
<h2>Account Preferences</h2>
If you have registered for an account with us through our Services, you can update your account
information or adjust your email communications preferences by logging into your account and
updating your settings.
<h2>GDPR and EU Data Subject Rights</h2>
Individuals in the European Economic Area ("EEA") and other jurisdictions have certain legal
rights with respect to the collection and use of their information through the Services. These rights
include:<br>
<b>Right of Access:</b> You have the right to obtain confirmation of whether we hold certain
information about you and to request a copy of that information.<br>
<b>Right to Rectify:</b> You can request the correction or updating of any inaccurate or
incomplete personal information we hold about you.<br>
<b>Right to Object:</b> You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data on
specific grounds, such as for marketing purposes or where we rely on legitimate interests.<br>
<b>Right to Withdraw Consent:</b> Where we process your information based on your consent,
you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.<br>
<b>Right to Complain:</b> If you believe that your data protection rights have been violated, you
have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory or legal authority.<br>
To exercise any of these rights or if you have any questions about how we handle your data, please
email us at info@fridayexp.com. We are committed to responding to your requests promptly and
within the timeframes required by GDPR. If necessary, this response time may be extended in
certain circumstances.
<h2>International Transfers</h2>
As described above in the "When We Disclose Your Information" section, we may share your
information with trusted service providers or business partners in countries other than your country
of residence in accordance with applicable law. This means that some of your information may be
processed in countries that may not offer the same level of protection as the privacy laws of your
jurisdiction. By providing us with your information, you acknowledge any such transfer, storage or
use.<br>
If we provide any information about you to any third parties information processors located
outside of the EEA, we will take appropriate measures to ensure such companies protect your
information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Policy and other data protection laws to
govern the transfers of such data.
<h2>Security Measures</h2>
We have implemented technical, physical, and organizational security measures to protect against
the loss, misuse, and/or alteration of your information. These safeguards vary based on the
sensitivity of the information that we collect and store. However, we cannot and do not guarantee
that these measures will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use, or disclose your
information since despite our efforts, no Internet and/or other electronic transmissions can be
completely secure.
<h2>Children</h2>
The Services are intended for users over the age of 18 and are not directed at children under the
age of 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information (as defined by the
Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) from children under the age of 13, or personal data (as
defined by the EU GDPR) from children under the age of 16, we will take reasonable steps to
delete it as soon as practicable.
<h2>Data Retention</h2>
We retain the information we collect for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes set forth in this
Privacy Policy or as long as we are legally required or permitted to do so. Information may persist
in copies made for backup and business continuity purposes for additional time.
<h2>Third-Party Links and Services</h2>
The Services may contain links to third-party websites (e.g., social media sites like Facebook and
Twitter), third-party plug-ins (e.g., the Facebook "like" button and Twitter "follow" button), and
other services. If you choose to use these sites or features, you may disclose your information not
just to those third-parties, but also to their users and the public more generally depending on how
their services function. Creative Commons is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of
such third party websites or services. The collection, use and disclosure of your information will be
subject to the privacy policies of the third party websites or services, and not this Privacy Policy.
We encourage you to read the privacy statements of each and every site you visit.
<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
We will continue to evaluate this Privacy Policy as we update and expand our Services, and we
may make changes to the Privacy Policy accordingly. We will post any changes here and revise the
date last updated above. We encourage you to check this page periodically for updates to stay
informed on how we collect, use and share your information. If we make material changes to this
Privacy Policy, we will provide you with notice as required by law.
